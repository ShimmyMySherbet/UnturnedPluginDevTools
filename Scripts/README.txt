To use these scripts:

[Script] ["PathToUnturnedServer"]

e.g.,
[Script] C:\Servers\Unturned

OR just drag the Unturned folder of your server onto the desired script file, and it will automatically run the script on that server.


NOTE:
If you do not have steamCMD on your pc/servers PATH, you must specify the path to SteamCMD.exe in each .bat file, at the top of the file.
